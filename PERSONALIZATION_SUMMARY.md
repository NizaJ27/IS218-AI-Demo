```

## User Flow

1. **First Visit**:
   - Create account (username + password)
   - Login
   - Complete intake assessment (5 questions)
   - Receive therapist recommendation
   - Start therapy session

2. **Returning Visit**:
   - Login with credentials
   - Automatically assigned to recommended therapist
   - Continue therapy from where they left off
   - View progress in sidebar

3. **During Session**:
   - Chat with assigned therapist
   - Sessions auto-save every 2 exchanges
   - Manual save option available
   - View goals and progress in sidebar
   - Change therapist if needed

4. **Logout**:
   - Current session automatically saved
   - All progress preserved for next visit

## Therapist Recommendation Algorithm

The intake assessment uses a weighted scoring system:

- Each answer option assigns points to relevant therapists
- Questions weight different therapies based on:
  - Primary presenting concern
  - Preferred therapeutic approach
  - Emotional processing style
  - Timeline expectations
- Final recommendation is the highest-scoring therapist
- Users see their top 3 matches with explanations

### Example Matching:
- **Anxiety + Practical tools + Negative thoughts** → Dr. Sourdough (CBT)
- **Past trauma + Deep exploration + Long-term** → Dr. Brioche (Psychodynamic)
- **Emotional overwhelm + Skills training** → Dr. Pumpernickel (DBT)
- **Quick solution + Future-focused** → Dr. Focaccia (Solution-Focused)

## Security Considerations

- **Password Hashing**: SHA-256 (consider bcrypt for production)
- **User Data Privacy**: All user data gitignored
- **Session Isolation**: Each user's data stored separately
- **No Plain Text Passwords**: Only hashes stored

## Data Persistence

All user data persists in JSON format:

**User Profile Example**:
```json
{
  "username": "alex_user",
  "password_hash": "5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292...",
  "created_at": "2025-10-31T15:30:00",
  "last_login": "2025-10-31T16:45:00",
  "assigned_therapist": "Sourdough (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)",
  "recommended_therapist": "Sourdough (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)",
  "intake_completed": true,
  "intake_responses": {...},
  "therapy_goals": ["Manage anxiety", "Improve sleep"],
  "progress_notes": [],
  "total_sessions": 3,
  "session_history": [...]
}
```

**Session Log Example**:
```json
{
  "session_id": "20251031_163000",
  "username": "alex_user",
  "therapist": "Sourdough (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)",
  "start_time": "2025-10-31T16:30:00",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm feeling anxious..."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's examine that thought pattern..."}
  ],
  "message_count": 12
}
```

## Future Enhancements

2. **Therapist Notes**: System for therapists to add session summaries
3. **Goal Tracking**: Mark goals as completed, add sub-goals
4. **Session Reviews**: Rate sessions, provide feedback
5. **Export Data**: Download session history
6. **Multi-Therapist**: Switch between therapists while maintaining history
