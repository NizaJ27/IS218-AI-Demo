- Ensure the `.env` file is in the same directory as `streamlit_app.py`

### "Model not found"
- Ensure you have access to the selected model in your OpenAI account
- Try selecting a different model from the dropdown

### Application not loading
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensure you're running the command from the project directory

## Extending the Application

This basic interface can be extended with additional features:
